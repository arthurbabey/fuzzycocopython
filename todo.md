## TODO :

1. Check why some sets seems to small in plot_aggregated_output 

2. Improve feature_names management 

3. Properly extract information out out the cpp code instead of parsinge (.ffs for models i.e variables and rules) and .log.txt for fireRules levels

3. To match scikit-learn API one way is to create two classes : classier & regressor. Need to undersand how fuzzycoco is managing that to integrate it in the python API

4. Extensive test on the python code and benchmark time between cpp exec and python api
